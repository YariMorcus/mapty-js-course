# Mapty project

The goal of this project was to learn how to plan a web project, work with OOP, the Geolocation API, the LocalStorage API and how to use external libraries (in this case [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)).

The Mapty project makes it possible for people to:

1. Add a running or cycling workout to their selected location.

   - This includes information such as:
     1. The type (running or cycling)
     2. Distance
     3. Duration
     4. Cadence _(only applicable to running)_
     5. Elevation gain _(only applicable to cycling)_

2. Easily go back to a workout by clicking on it in the left sidebar.
